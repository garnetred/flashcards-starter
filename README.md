# Flashcards project

## Abstract
In this project, I used an existing repo to create a flashcard game that is playable in the command line. I followed TDD principles to decrease the amount of potential bugs as I was coding. If a user answers less than 90 percent of questions correctly, they will have to complete all of the questions all over again. If the user is able to answer more than 90 percent of questions correctly, the game ends. 

You can view the finished project below:

## Installation
In order to play the game, you can fork this repository and clone down the repo. You can type the following code in the terminal once in the directory in order to begin playing the game.

```node index.js```
